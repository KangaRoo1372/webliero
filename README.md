This repository contains my own works regarding [WEBLIERO](https://www.webliero.com) - an online version (powered by basro) of classic MS-DOS freeware game called [LIERO](https://www.liero.be) created by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998. It contains my own mods made for this game (each mod is in a separate folder, where you can also find a detailed description of each mod). Enjoy!
---------------------------------------------------
To use the mod, run webliero in your browser, create your own room, then open the chat window (enter by default), type "/loadmod" in the console (without the quotes) and select the mod from the directory (where you downloaded the mod). Generally, each mod consists of two files: the json file (which contains "logic" part of the mod, i.e. physics, weapons etc.) and wlsprt file (which contains gfx part of the mod, i.e. sprites and palette). So, to load the full mod, you should choose both files together (json and wlsprt file) after typing "/loadmod" in the chat window.

If you want more content regarding Webliero, [visit the "official" webliero gitlab repository](https://www.gitlab.com/webliero). You can find there more mods created by other people and many other cool stuff, especially custom maps (there are also some maps created by me - you can find them [here](https://www.gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-maps/-/tree/master/kangaroo)).
