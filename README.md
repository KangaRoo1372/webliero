This repository contains my own works regarding WEBLIERO - an online version (made by basro) of classic MS-DOS freeware game called LIERO made by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998. It contains my own mods made for this game, i.e. "Roo Fun Mod" (based on Scharnvirk's Promode ReRevisited) and "WeblieroZ" (based on liero Dragon Ball Z mod). Enjoy!
---------------------------------------------------
To use the mod, run webliero in your browser, create your own room, then open the chat window (enter by default), type /loadmod in the console and select the mod from the directory (where you downloaded the mod). The mod was made using standard gfx from promode mod, so that it works the best with sprites from promode (you can also download sprites file from this repository - file sprites.wlsprt). So, to load the full mod, you should choose both files together (json and wlsprt file) after typing "loadmod" in the chat window.

I also created some custom maps for webliero - if you are interested, you can find them here: https://gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-maps/-/tree/master/kangaroo
