This repository contains my own works regarding an online version of classic MS-DOS freeware game called LIERO made by Joosa Riekkinen and released in 1998. It contains my own mods (currently one - "Fun Roo Mod", based on Scharnvirk's Promode ReRevisited) made to this game and some maps. Enjoy!
To use the mod, run webliero in your browser, create your own room, then open the chat window (enter by default), type /loadmod in the console and select the mod from the directory (where you downloaded the mod). The mod was made using standard gfx from promode mod, so that it works the best with sprites from promode.
