Hi fellow worms!

A long time ago (circa in 2001, but I'm not 100% sure), a nice worm called Biernath John (who was a legendary guy among Polish Liero community organised around "Liga Liero" Forum) decided to create a Total Conversion of Liero 1.33,  which would be aimed on fast, furious, quake-like deathmatch on Liga Liero settings. He decided to changed the worm and rope physics totally, remove most annoying weapons like dirtball or RB Rampage, rework some other weapons and make some new ones.

And that's how he created Liero Promode Final - one of the best and most popular Liero TCs of all time.

Although he had named his TC "final", further several changes were made by other people, or strictly speaking - other ppl created their own promode-based conversions. The most famous one is "Promode ReRevisited" created by jerrac a.k.a. Szarnywirk.

Liero Promode ReRevisited was based on Liero Promode TC (specifically on "Liero Promode Revisited" - one of the aforementioned Liero Promode Final conversions), adjusted for WebLiero. As we can read it the official README, "less spammy weapons, less particles and quick movement are the main features".

Since the official release, jerrac - after many tests - made several changes in his mod, to make it even better. Currently, the official version is 1.3.2 BETA, which can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-mods/-/tree/master/Jerac/ReRevisited).

However, the history likes to repeat itself... as in the past, when later conversions of promode final were created by various people who were not its creator - promode rerevisited is now being developed by various people.

And here are my own (con)versions of Promode ReRevisited.

As you can see, there are two subdirectories in this folder: first one called "ffa", and the second one called "duel".

In the first one, you can find my version of Promode ReRevisited, reworked to make it suitable for FFA (free for all) games. And in the second one, you can find the same mod, but reworked in different way, ofc to make it suitable for duels.

Someone might ask: why make two different versions of the mod? So I explain: in my opinion, it is practically impossible to create a universal mod that will suit both ffa and duels. These game modes are so different from each other, so that one and the same weapon may be too powerful for ffa, while in duels it is completely useless - and vice versa. Therefore, I decided to create two versions of the mod.

In each folder, you will find a full changelog where you can see and check all the changes I made.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to write or submit your suggestions!
