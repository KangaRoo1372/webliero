# PROMODE (Re)ReReVisited (a.k.a. KDP New Ffa Promode)

Hi guys!

As you read in the previous readme file, you can find here my version of Webliero Promode ReRevisited Mod, reworked to make it suitable for FFA (free for all) games. The mod is based on the latest version of original Promode ReRevisited, i.e. 1.3.2. BETA. It is also recommended to use original Promode ReReviisted sprites while playing this mod (you can find the wlsprt file in the official Promode ReRevisited repository on gitlab).

Basically, all changes I made - comparing to Promode ReRevisited original settings - refer only to some weapons (the gravity or other main "physics" parameters of the gameplay, which you can find in part "contants" and "textures", remains unchanged). Here you can find the full list of aforementioned changes:

1. MORTAR
2. GRENADE
3. GRN LAUNCHER
4. FLAMER
5. ZIMM
6. RIFLE
7. FLAK CANNON
8. MISSILE
9. WINCHESTER
10. DARTGUN
11. CHAINGUN
12. MINIGUN
13. SCATTERGUN
14. MINI NUKE
15. LASER
16. ACID FAN
