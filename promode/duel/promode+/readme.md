# PROMODE+ (Re)ReReVisited (duel edition)

Hello my fellow Lieros!

In this directory you can find my another version of Webliero Promode ReRevisited Mod, reworked to make it suitable for duels. Generally, it is based on my Promode (Re)ReReVisited 1v1 (duel) edition (which you can find in the previous folder). The main difference between those two mods is that I added some new weapons, a list of which you can find below.

What is more, I also replaced AUTO SHOTGUN with brand new weapon AUTOCANNON (based on FLAKCANNON from kami's csliero rewormed mod) and tweaked PROXY MINE a little bit experimentally (if no worm collides with it, it falls to the ground after some time, where it will remain for some time).

It is recommended to use original Promode ReRevisited sprites while playing this mod (you can find the wlsprt file in the [official Promode ReRevisited repository on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-mods/-/tree/master/Jerac/ReRevisited)).

List of new weapons:

1. BLASTER
2. BOUNCY MINE
3. AUTOCANNON
4. FIRECRACKER
5. NAPALM
6. PANZERFAUST
