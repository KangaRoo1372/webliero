WeblieroZ (a.k.a. Dragon Ball Z Liero Mod) - as the name suggests, this mod is inspired by the Dragon Ball Z anime & "Liero: Dragon Ball Z Edition" Total Conversion created by The Jelly King. In this mod I created numerous new weapons, the description of which can be found below. In addition to weapons, the physics of the worm has changed a bit. The mod is based on the promode final sprites (with two exceptions - SSJ golden hair has been added to the worm sprites and health boxes have been changed into dragon balls), but I plan to create an alternative version of this mod based on my own sprites.

1) Kamehameha - a powerful ki energy wave. One of the most powerful energy beams in DBZ saga. Son Goku's signature technique.

2) Final Flash - another powerful ki energy wave. One of the most powerful energy beams in DBZ saga. Invented by Vegeta.
