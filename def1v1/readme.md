Def ReRevisited (1v1 version) - a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away... :P), there was a nice guy called Daro who was a big fan of basro's game called GUSANOS (an epic Liero clone). Daro wanted to "port" default mod from gusanos into Webliero - and that's how he created famous Webliero "def" mod. So, as the name suggests, my aim was to "re-visit" this mod and revise some of its weapons, in order to make this mod more suitable for Webliero, especially for duels. The mod was made using sprites taken from liero promode final mod (you can also download the sprite file from this repository - file "def1v1.wlsprt"). Comparing to original Daro's def mode, the changes include:

a) main "physics" parameters of the gameplay (part "constans" - I used liero promode rerevisited original settings);

b) weapon changes (the list of weapons below).

1. PANZERFAUST
2. SOLAR FLAME
3. RAILGUN
4. MACHINE GUN
5. FLAMETHROWER
6. PLASMA SHOTGUN
7. LASER CUTTER
8. CLUSTER BOMB
9. UZUMAKI
10. NAPALM
11. DIRT SHIELD
12. MAGNETIC FIELD
