If you are a true Liero lover, then for sure you remember two most annoying weapons in classic Liero: DIRTBALL and GREENBALL.

But have you ever thought how those two weapons actually work? These weapons are totally different from all other weapons - since they are the only two weapons which are used not to kill other worms & destroy the dirt, but to CREATE something on the map...

So, after some tests, I found out how those weapons actually work (that was not that hard though). Then I wondered: if it is possible to create some DIRT on the map - maybe it is also possible to create some SOLID material (i.e. rock or special rock) on the map in that way?

So, after further tests, I accidentaly found how to make such weapon (i.e. which work like dirtball, but creates rock on the map instead of dirt). My idea was to use such weapon to "trap" enemies inside something pretending to be a rock prison. But let's be clear - that was stupid idea (after some time, especially when such weapon was overused, the map was totally filled with rock and it was impossible to play).

Then, a nice guy called dsds saw my works and hit upon a brilliant idea...

What if we could make a mod with ONLY such weapons intentionally? What if we make a mod, which aim will be not to kill others, but to... BUILD?

LIKE IN MINECRAFT? (using special bricks)

...and this is how the first ever non-aggressive (web)liero mod was created.

THE BUILDER MOD.

So, as I wrote above, the purpose of the game in this mod is to build something (using special weapons), or strictly speaking - to draw a map that you can then play on. You have a lot of nice different bricks which you can use to do that. You have also some other nice stuff, like e.g. pencil, paint brush, line marker... and if you get trapped in your own bricks, you can just use "suicide" to respawn...

...or just use special ERASER to remove your drawings (yeh, maybe it sounds crazy but it is possible to make a weapon in Liero which can be used to remove rock or special rock).

As I wrote above, the originator of this mod was dsds who also made all sprites for this mod. I collaborated with him, i.e. helped him make some weapons. The mod is still being developed and dsds is the person who is a supervisor over this mod. That's why I will not upload it here. But you can find it here: https://gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-mods/-/tree/master/kangaroo%2Bdsds/buildingame. Currently there is also a dedicated room (24h) hosted on webliero with this mod loaded & some special scripting (ofc powered by dsds). Enjoy!
