Liero Xmass 2020 Mod - this mod is a special Christmas 2020 edition of Scharnvirk's Promode ReRevisited mod (version 1.3.1). The mod is mainly based on a fun xmas theme sprite change (the worms are wearing nice santa claus hats) + some changes regarding blood, which now is white and acts... as snow (sic! sounds terrible, but believe me, it was really the only way to make snow in webliero). There are also some changes regarding weapons of which the description is below.

A/ Added weapons:
1. DEADLY GIFT - maybe it looks beautiful, but you'd better not touch and unpack it!
2. CHRISTMAS TREE - it's always nice to sit by the Christmas tree... but not too long (cuz it can explode)!

B/ Weapons changed:
1. SPIKEBALLS = SNOWFLAKES
2. TUPOLEV = SANTA CLAUS
3. THROW KNIFE = SNOWBALLS

The mod was created in a collaboration with dsds who made epic maps for this mod (which can be found here: https://gitlab.com/webliero/webliero-maps/-/tree/master/dsds/xmas2020) and also wrote a special xmass room script (which can be found here: https://github.com/s-dsds/webliero-xmas-room) The maps work only with special sprite edition (which is ofc uploaded here in this repo - file "xmass2.wlsprt") with changed palette, but if you want to play this mod on standard maps, you can also find here the "normal" colors sprite file (file "xmass1.wlsprt"). Enjoy!
